'''You need a array to indicated visited nodes
    1.) Creat set S of nodes whose shortest distance from source is known 
    2.) Initially, S only contains the source or starting node
    3.) At each step, add to S a remaining node v whose distance(cost) from the 
       source is as short(cheapest) as possible
